# Hands_on_Machine_Learning_summarized-
This series of summaries have been a part of my internship at shai as a machine learning engineer.

Chapter 1 Summary - Key Points:

Defining Machine Learning: Computers learning from data without explicit programming.
Applications: Spam detection, image analysis, fraud detection, and more.
Learning Types:
Supervised Learning: Learning with known labels.
Unsupervised Learning: Discovering patterns in data.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning via trial and error and rewards.
Challenges:
Insufficient or poor-quality data.
Overfitting or underfitting models.

Chapter 2 Report - Key Points:

Project Steps:
Defining the problem and gathering data.
Exploring, visualizing, and preparing data.
Selecting and training models.
Fine-tuning and deploying models.
Best Practices: Use Kaggle and UC Irvine repository for datasets.
Model Evaluation: Use mean squared error for regression and accuracy for classification.
Fine-tuning: Grid search, cross-validation, and ensemble methods.
Deployment and Maintenance: Monitoring model performance and updating as needed.
